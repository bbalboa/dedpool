## Goals: 

1. Mitigate bio-matter from entering water ways.
1. Capture NPK (Nitrogen, Phosurus, Potasium) readings & send to reporting dashboard.
1. Monitor Baffle Box contents & report when it needs to be emptied.
1. Empower biologists with additional data that may one day lead to accurate bloom prediction.

## Open Questions:

Power - Solar

Communication  - WiFi (WAN), LTE

Data size (storage)

Time to Failure

Volume vs Duration - data collection set

## Selling Points
