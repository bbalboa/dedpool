1. Filter system that attracts pollutants for sewers that drain into the IRL. 
-Baffle box - measure impurities, best management practices (app competition).

2. A device that attaches to boats that can attract polluntants then pulled out of water. 

3. "Buffer zone"
- Cattails

4. Political initivies - phosphate mining

5. What is the balance? nature + human influence.

6. Infographic - The problem, Affects, Solutions.
- More info on what people can do (little to 0 cost)

7. Breed more algae eating fish, but how to control
-oysters/clams

8. Smell 

9. Augmented Reality App - IRL info, etc?

10. Predictive algorithm for blooms - each algae is different for bloom? nutrients are a factor, sun, etc
Algae calc

contributing factors
- phosphates
- termidity

EPA - https://www.epa.gov/waterdata

brown algae - 20miles oyster
muck - dead stuffs - 
nutrient flow - run off 

REQUESTS:
Hubbs-Seaworld Research Institute
-Digitizing paper surveys (dozens of these are filled out while on the boat weekly for each dolphin sighted which is extremely cumbersome).

- An application where citizens can report stranded or dead dolphins and otter sightings. Researching location data from these animals directly impacts the IRL and our human population. 

- Algorithm for dorsal fin detection and/or an automatic cropping application. The research staff and volunteers go through thousands of photos each week and identify/match dolphins to ones already in our database. Photo ID is our biggest and most time consuming program.

- Here's some more info and photos on our surveys http://discoverfloridasoceans.com/?s=survey . I've also included a copy of the physical paper they fill out while on the boat. It includes:

- gps info, taken from the gps.

- water salinity and depth, taken from another device (if we could ever get gps and water devices to load straight to the application, that would be cool). The info on the water quality is also charted to keep historical records of the condition of the lagoon and where animals can thrive. 

- info on the dolphin (some may be known) and location spotted.
- liver serirosis


- Manatees - Population, warm water
